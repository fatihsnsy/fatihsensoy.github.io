Even though malicious applications are offense-oriented, they often demonstrate defensive capabilities in order to sustain their offensive behavior longer and more effectively. In this cat-and-mouse game, one of the biggest goals of malicious actors is to try to prevent their malware from being analyzed as much as possible. Together with you, we will examine and realize a technique that we often hear about, which is outdated but can be considered the beginning of the cat-and-mouse game.

But before we get into the details and implementation of the technique, knowing what TLS is will give us a great advantage.

## What is TLS?

TLS, which stands for **Thread Local Storage**, is a method by which the threads (**thread**) of a process can store their unique data in memory. At runtime (**runtime**), thread-specific data can be supported by Windows APIs such as TlsAlloc, TlsGetvValue, TlsSetValue. It is also known that all threads of a process share the same virtual space. A local variable in a function is specific to the thread that executes it. However, static and global variables outside the function are shared by all threads of the process. The situation is slightly different for variables created in the TLS structure. In the TLS structure, threads have their own unique copies for variables.  In other words, in the TLS structure, the value of a variable that is changed only changes in the relevant thread. Since other threads have their own copies, there is no change.

With TLS, it is possible for the process to provide data specific to each thread by using a global index. The following image shows exactly how TLS works.

![TLS Callback Cover](img/cover.png) 

In the image above, you can see two threads using TLS. TLS creates 2 global data named gdwTlsIndex1 and gdwTlsIndex2. With the TlsGetValue API, the value corresponding to the relevant indexes of the threads is stored in the lpvData variable.

## Debug Detection with TLS Callback

Now that we have a little bit of a grasp of the TLS logic to understand the topic of this article, let's get back to the topic at hand. The old tradition (I say old because many modern debug detection methods have been developed.  We will take a look at how to detect debug with TLS Callback.

One of the biggest reasons why TLS Callback is popular is that it works before the **entrypoint**. This means that malicious actors can use TLS Callback at the beginning of the program to see if their malicious application is being debugged before the main purpose of their application is known. TLS Callback is an old anti-debug technique that can be easily bypassed today.

To better understand the TLS Callback anti-debug technique, let's implement it.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <windows.h>
#pragma comment(lib, "ntdll.lib")
#pragma section(".CRT$XLB", read) //We created a new section called CRT$XLB. The name of the section must be the same.
#define NtCurrentProcess() (HANDLE)-1
extern "C" NTSTATUS NTAPI NtQueryInformationProcess(HANDLE hProcess, ULONG InfoClass, PVOID Buffer, ULONG Length, PULONG ReturnLength);
#ifdef _WIN64
#pragma comment(linker, "/INCLUDE:_tls_used")
#define readpeb (PBOOLEAN)__readgsdword(0x60) + 2 // Points to BeingDebugged in the PEB structure. for x64
#else
#pragma comment(linker, "/INCLUDE:__tls_used")
#define readpeb (PBOOLEAN)__readfsdword(0x30) + 2 // for x32 
#endif
void WINAPI DebuggerDetect(PVOID handle, DWORD Reason, PVOID Reserved) {
    PBOOLEAN BeingDebugged = readpeb;
    HANDLE DebugPort = NULL;
    if (*BeingDebugged) {
        printf("Debugger Detected!!!\n");
    }
    else {
        printf("No debugger detected!\n");
    }
    if (!NtQueryInformationProcess(NtCurrentProcess(), 7, &DebugPort, sizeof(HANDLE), NULL)) { 
        // If DebugPort is not 0, it indicates that the program is debugged.
        if (DebugPort) {
            printf("Debugger Detected via QueryInformationProcess!!!\n");
            exit(1);
        }
        else {
            printf("No debugger detected for QueryInformationProcess\n");
        }
    }
}
__declspec(allocate(".CRT$XLB")) PIMAGE_TLS_CALLBACK CallbackAddress[] = { DebuggerDetect, NULL };
int main() {
    printf("Hello, you're now in the entrypoint!");
    return 0;
}
```

Let's take a look at the anti-debug technique with the TLS Callback we implemented above. In our example where we add an anti-debug technique with the **NtQueryInformationProcess** API, we give instructions to our compiler with pragma keywords. You can already see commands such as include ntdll library, create a new section, link the specified ones to the linker in the code.  One of the most important points here is the line we define with the **____declspec** keyword. We allocate space for the section we created in the pragma keyword and give the address of our TLS Callback function. Then the **DebuggerDetect** function we wrote is running and after this function our **main**() function is running.

In our x86 and x64 architecture compatible implementation, we first need to access the PEB structure according to the architecture. After accessing the PEB structure, we specify the 2nd index to access BeingDebugged, which is the 3rd variable of the structure as seen in the table above. If BeingDebugged has a value other than 0, it means that the program is debugged. It should also be noted that the position of PEB differs according to the architecture in the above code fragment.

After the anti-debug technique with PEB, we improve our anti-debug application a little more by making a small addition. By taking advantage of the Windows APIs, we can see if the application is being debugged or not. As you can see in the example, we have used a similar anti-debug technique with the **NtQueryInformationProcess** API, which, as we just mentioned, finds the starting point of the PEB according to the architecture and performs almost the same operations as us. We assign a value of 7 to the **ProcessInformationClass** parameter and assign it to the **DebugPort** variable. If the **DebugPort** variable has a value other than 0, it means that the program is being debugged.

In this article, we have talked about the definition and structure of TLS in general, debug detection with TLS Callback and PEB structure. In my next articles, I will be with you with different anti-debug and anti-reverse techniques. Stay safe...
